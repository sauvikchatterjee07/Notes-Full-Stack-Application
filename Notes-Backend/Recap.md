##Update Logic:

Extracts the title and content from req.body.
Constructs an updates object with the fields that need to be updated.
Uses Note.findByIdAndUpdate to find the note by ID and update it with the provided fields. The { new: true, runValidators: true } options ensure that the updated document is returned and validation rules are applied.
